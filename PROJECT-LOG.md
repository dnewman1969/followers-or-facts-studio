# Project log

Read this first in a new session, then add to it at the end.

## 2026-10-22 — v0.1: the merged program

Built Followers or Facts Studio from Dave's repos (truth-vlog, OwlBox, EchoForge,
Nimrod's Tower, ai-agent-studio, the VoxBox family) and the "Free AI Video Creator"
handoff. One Python 3.12 app, native Windows window (PySide6).

**Works and is tested** (21 automated tests, run on Linux with ffmpeg; GPU services faked):

- Research database imported into SQLite with the same IDs: 487 claims, 388 sources,
  54 arcs, 353 people, 1,145 KF episodes. Six shifted arc rows repaired, the duplicate
  Flynn merged, 16 duplicate links dropped. Validator: 0 errors.
- The full pipeline from research packet to packaged video, with every editorial gate.
- Render engine (stills with camera moves, video clips, transitions, narration, ducked
  music, subtitles) produces correct-length MP4s with sound.
- Kokoro voice tested for real: 54 voices, `bm_george` default, ~2x real time on a CPU.
- Job queue: one job at a time, heartbeats, pauses on failure.

**Written but not yet run against the real services** (needs Dave's PC):

- Ollama prompts for script, storyboard and quote finding (Qwen 3 14B).
- ComfyUI templates: Z-Image Turbo, Wan 2.2 I2V + Lightning, ACE-Step. Written from
  ComfyUI's examples; node names may need a tweak on first run.
- faster-whisper word timing (falls back to estimated timing if it can't run).
- YouTube upload.
- Render Mode suspend/resume on Windows; NVENC encoding.

## Next

1. Dave: run `setup.ps1`, then make S01E01 (Y2K fear industry) with Animation and Music skipped.
2. Fix whatever the first real run turns up in the ComfyUI templates and prompts.
3. Owlbert on model: turnaround sheet, LoRA, intro/outro shots.
4. Shorts: vertical clips from the render.
5. Research intake: Scout-style lead extraction from new transcripts into the database.
6. The followersorfacts.com static site from the sourced claims.

## Decisions

- Everything free for a monetized US channel: no MiniMax H3, XTTS, F5-TTS, FLUX dev.
- Python everywhere; OwlBox's Node engines rewritten in Python.
- Native Windows app (PySide6), not a browser UI.
- Code in git; media and models in `F:\AI\fof-data` (never committed).
- Voice cloning only for voices with a consent record (`voices/<name>/rights.json`).
